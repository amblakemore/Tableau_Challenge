Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Start Time
Looking at the start time during the winter (January 2020) and the summer (June 2020), we can see the there is a larger use of the bikes during the summer. This can be attributed to the better weather for New York during the summer. June clearly has a higher demand for the bikes, but I found it interesting that there was almost the same demand for bikes in the morning (8 AM) in January as the peak (5 PM). This was not the same for June. This could possibly be attributed to the pandemic and fewer people going to work, but thought it was interesting.

## Top/Bottom 10 Stations
I am not familiar with New York City and the most popular stations did not seem to completely surprise me. Some of the stations are located on famous streets that most people would have heard of (Broadway, Pershing Square). These are centrally located in the city and it would make sense that there is a higher demand for the bikes in these locations.

When looking at the map and seeing bottom 10 stations, they are very remote and far away from the city. It would make sense that there were very few bikes used from these locations.

## Gender
Looking at the demographics of the customers and subscribers, the customer base is largely dominated by females with females having double the male base. When looking a the subscribers vs the customers, unsurprisingly the customer base grew in June 2020 compared to January 2020. This could be because of the better weather and typical trend during the summer. However, because of the pandemic, there was much less travel. It's possible that the growth in the customer base was due to people using the bikes to leave their homes during the day
